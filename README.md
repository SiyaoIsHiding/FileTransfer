# File Transfer Using TCP

A coursework project for Network Programming. It is multi-threaded and enables the user to specify a folder to be served in the server side.
## Server
Provide the name of the folder to be served as an argument in command line when starting the server: `java FileHTTPServer public` as an example.

## Client
There are three commands available.
1. `index` to list available files.
2. `get file_name.txt` to fetch the file.
3. `q` to quit the program.
